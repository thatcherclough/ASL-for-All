## How it works
ASL for All is an English to American Sign Language translator.

It uses videos from [SigningSavvy](https://www.signingsavvy.com/) and an English to ASL grammar translator to seamlessly translate English sentences to videos depicting American Sign Language.

The ASL grammar translator is a modified version of Harsh Bhavsar's English to ASL grammar algorithm (see [credits](https://github.com/thatcherclough/ASL-for-All#credits)), and this modified version (which can be found [here](https://github.com/thatcherclough/ASLGrammarTranslator)) is used in the custom ASL for All API.
This custom python API can be found in the "api" folder. More information about this API can be found in its [documentation](api/README.md).

Further development information:

While the Xcode project will compile, it will not run properly because an API base url is required when running ``pod install``. 

## Installation
ASL for All can be installed from the [App Store](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/asl-for-all/id1603768412).

- Better concatenation
- Better video management (expecially with export)
- Better video player
- Keys for API
- Better loading animation
- VideoView PlayerItem ram handling
- Starting screen text cuts off
